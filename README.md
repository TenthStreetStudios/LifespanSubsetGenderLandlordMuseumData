# LifespanSubsetGenderLandlordMuseumData
A subset of the Lifespan dataset collapses year-to-year tenant data into one entry
per tenant to create a full list of tenant names. Each tenant is then coded with a
binary gender label (1 for women, 0 for men). Every tenant is further coded by their
first Studio Building landlord (0 for TSS, 1 for J. B. and J. T. Johnston, and 2 for J. H.
Johnston) and with binary labels indicating whether their work is part of the Met’s
or SAAM’s collections according to the museums’ websites (1 for yes, 0 for no for
each museum, and for the museums combined). For tenants with works in these
collections, the number of objects per tenant that each museum contains is
recorded in separate columns. This dataset is part of the Mining @ Tenth Street Project (tenthstreetstudios.com) and an
article published by Panorama: Journal of the Historians of American Art.
